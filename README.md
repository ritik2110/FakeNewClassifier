Fake news is a problem that existed way before internet existed, usually in the form of verbal conversations, but now in this day and age fakenews is so much embedded in our society that it is threatning to every democracy in the world. In this project I tried to construct a FakeNews classifier using deep learning algorithm that is trained to identify fakenews. This DL model uses Long-short-term-memory (LSTM) for making it's predictions. I have also encorporated NLTK library for the preprocessing of the text input and converted it to vectors using one-hot represenatation.
This algorithm is able to sort after Fakenews with a accuracy upwards of 87%.
