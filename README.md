Fake New Classifier is a deep learning algorithm that is trained to identify fake news. This DL model uses Long-short-term-memory (LSTM) for making it's predictions. I have used NLTK library for preprocessing the text input and to convert them in vectors using one-hot represenatation.
This algorithm is able to sort after fake new with a accuracy of 87.54%.
